# tic-tax-toe

tic-tax-toe, the small project I had done during learning JavaScript. The game itself is completed and somewhat polished. The only downside for this game is that the bot doesn't take any strategy to win the game, which impose no challenge to user. Hopefully, you will still find little joy within it.
